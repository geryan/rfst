# Introduction

Illustrative example of results products from STEPS PVA modelling for Leadbeater's Possum *Gymnobelideus leadbeateri* and Greater Glider *Petauroides volans* in the Central Highlands Regional Forestry Agreement zone.

**These results are intended as examples of the types of output information available from the process, and should not be considered definitive results of any given scenario or outcome**

Here we explore three potential landscape management scenarios:

- Business as usual (ongoing harvest),
- Ceasing harvest after 30 years, and 
- No timber harvesting.

Each of these scenarios is modelled under the current planned burning regime, and following the mid-range severity climate pathway RCP 4.5, using the Access 1.0 model. It is important to note that it is vital to consdier other climate pathways in this modelling as this can have large effects on the forecasts of suitable habitat.

For each of the three scenarios we have run 10 LANDIS simulations, for a total of 30 LANDIS simulations, each of will result in different simulated landscapes. This is because LANDIS is a stochastic model where growth, scenescence, harvesting, bushfire, and planned burning will vary with each run of the model. We intend to increase the number of landscape simulations in order to better capture variation among landscape management scenarios, as well as the stochastic noise.

For each of these 30 LANDIS simulations we complete a population viability analysis (PVA) for each species, which is itself a stochastic model. Each of these PVAs consists of 100 simulated populations.

Here we generally illustrate results for a single LANDIS simulation in each scenario.

# Disturbances

## Fires

## Populaition viability analysis

## All life stages
Population for each life history stage over 100 simulations for a single LANDIS simulation of each management scenario.

Coloured lines are mean, grey lines are population over a single simulation. Panels are newborn (left), juvenile (middle), and adult (right) populations.

## Total population

Total population for each of 100 PVA simulations for a single LANDIS simulation of each management scenario.

Dark grey line is mean, grey ribbon is 95% bound of simulated population size, and light grey lines are population over a single PVA simulation. Dotted line below is the expected minimum population size, which is red when it equals zero.
